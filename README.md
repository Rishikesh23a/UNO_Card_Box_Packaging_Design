The aim was to create a packaging solution that is:

• Structurally strong

• Visually attractive

• Brand-consistent

• Eco-friendly

• Easy to manufacture and assemble

<h2>🎯 2. Project Objectives</h2>

• Design a 3D mockup + physical prototype

• Create an accurate dieline/packaging layout

• Build a functional paper prototype

• Design artwork following UNO’s brand identity

• Capture realistic product photographs

• Improve packaging usability and shelf presence

<h2>🧱 3. Packaging Structure</h2>

✔ Box Type

• Flip-top tuck-in style

• Standard UNO card dimensions

✔ Material

• 300–350 GSM Paperboard

• Fully recyclable, eco-friendly

✔ Strength Features

• Lock-flap for secure closure

• Proper side support to avoid card bending

• Compact and ergonomic structure

<h2>🎨 4. Visual Design Elements</h2>

The visual design follows UNO’s fun and energetic identity:

| Component            | Description                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
